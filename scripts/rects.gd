## Print where the controls REALLY are, in the coordinate space a replay uses.
##
##   godot --path . --resolution 460x996 --script res://scripts/rects.gd
##
## **A headless run cannot answer this.** A headless root reports 100x100 and
## every anchored control resolves against that, so a replay written from a
## headless probe lands every tap in the top-left fifth of the screen, hits
## nothing, and films a game that looks broken rather than a coordinate that is.
## So this opens a real window, lets the layout resolve over several frames, and
## prints the global rects.
##
## **It walks the scene.** The version this replaces named four controls out of
## the game it was copied from - `_hud._pad`, `_uplink_btn`, `_lamp_btn`,
## `_manifest._close` - so it threw on the first frame of every game scaffolded
## from this template, which is to say it has never once run where it shipped.
## A tool that names the thing it inspects has to be edited before it can be
## used; a tool that finds it works on day one. Nothing below knows what game
## this is.
##
## Also printed, because a rect alone is not enough to write a replay against:
## whether the control is visible, and whether it takes touches at all. A tap
## delivered to a control whose `mouse_filter` is IGNORE hits whatever is behind
## it, and a miss is not an error - it is a green run that proves nothing.

## Typed as `Node`, not as the game's root class. The template's own root
## declares `class_name Main`; the games scaffolded from it do not, so a typed
## `Main` here is a parse error in the repo this is copied into - and a script
## that cannot parse is a tool that has never run where it shipped, which is the
## exact fault the rewrite above was for. Nothing below needs the type.
