## APK size guard. Fails in BOTH directions.

##
## Growth is the obvious thing to watch. A shrink matters more, and is the
## reason this exists: on another game here a module split silently dropped the
## call that starts the frame loop. Every test passed, the typecheck was clean,
## the build succeeded, and the game was frozen on launch. The only signal
## anywhere was the bundle getting smaller, because everything reachable solely
## from that loop had been tree-shaken away as unreachable.
##
## A Godot export cannot tree-shake GDScript the same way, but the equivalent
## failures are real: an export preset that quietly stops including a
## directory, an `export_filter` change, a resource that stops being imported.
## All of those show up here as a drop and nowhere else.
##
## Run it after every export, in CI, before the artifact is published.
##
## **AND IT REFUSES TO MEASURE A STALE APK**, which is the other half of the job
## and the half that was missing.
##
## A guard whose input is a build artifact has to own the build. This one cannot
## - the export is a separate command - so it does the next best thing and
## checks that the APK in `build/` is newer than every source file that went
## into it. A sibling game added a whole room, nine imported props and a plank
## material, went from 35.62 MB to 64.58 MB against a 10% tolerance, and its
## local check printed `size ok` the entire time, because the APK in `build/`
## was from an earlier session and the guard was answering a question about a
## build nobody had made that day. CI exported first and caught it immediately.
##
## A green local check is not a green build. This is the second time on this
## machine that a local pass and a CI fail disagreed because the local step
## silently measured the wrong thing.
