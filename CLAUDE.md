# Godot phone-game template

The proving stack for Gideon's native Android games: a Godot 4 project with headless
tests, a whole-run golden, a size guard, CI, and an APK that installs on the phone.

**This is not a game.** It is the thing a game is copied from. It contains just enough
playable content — a track, something to dodge, something to collect — for the tests to
have something real to assert about.

**Read `C:\dev\gamedev-notes` first** — `SKILL.md` (process), `CRAFT.md` (design lessons,
all of which apply here; they are about games, not about JavaScript), `PIPELINE.md` (the
web stack and the shared principles), `ASSETS.md`, `PLAYTESTS.md`.

## Toolchain, and where it lives

Nothing is installed system-wide and nothing needed admin rights. Portable, under
`C:\dev\toolchain\`:

| Piece | Version | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Godot | 4.7.2 stable | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\GodotEngine.GodotEngine_*\Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64_console.exe` |
| JDK | Temurin 17.0.20.1 | `C:\dev\toolchain\jdk\jdk-17.0.20.1+1` |
| Android SDK | platform 36, build-tools 36.0.0, platform-tools 37.0.1 | `C:\dev\toolchain\android-sdk` |
| Debug keystore | | `C:\dev\toolchain\debug.keystore` (alias `androiddebugkey`, pass `android`) |
| Export templates | 4.7.2.stable | `%APPDATA%\Godot\export_templates\4.7.2.stable` |

Godot finds the SDK, the JDK and the keystore through **editor settings**, not through
environment variables — `%APPDATA%\Godot\editor_settings-4.7.tres`, keys under
`export/android/`. Setting `ANDROID_HOME` alone does nothing; that costs half an hour if
you do not know it.

## Commands

```powershell
$godot = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\GodotEngine.GodotEngine_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64_console.exe"

& $godot --headless --path . --import                                   # after adding files
& $godot --headless --path . --script res://test/run_tests.gd           # pure tests, ~1s
& $godot --headless --path . --script res://test/run_smoke.gd           # boots the real scene
& $godot --headless --path . --export-debug "Android" build/wrecking-crew.apk
& $godot --headless --path . --script res://scripts/check_size.gd       # size guard
& $godot --path .                                                        # open the editor
```

Every one exits non-zero on failure, which is what makes them a CI gate rather than
something to read.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/sim/sim.gd` | **The whole game, with no renderer in it.** |
| `src/sim/tuning.gd` | Every number that shapes how it feels, plus the derived arithmetic |
| `src/sim/util.gd` | `smooth`, `hash2`, `fmt` — pure, and the hash is load-bearing |
| `src/sim/rng.gd` | A seeded stream for values that decide *when* something happens |
| `src/game/main.gd` | The shell: reads `Sim`, draws it, feeds it input. Decides nothing |
| `src/game/main.tscn` | Four lines. One node with the script; the world is built in code |
| `src/build_stamp.gd` | Overwritten at build time. Committed fallback says `dev` |
| `src/changelog.gd` | `VERSION` and the player-facing history |
| `test/run_tests.gd` | Pure tests. No node, no viewport, no GPU |
| `test/run_smoke.gd` | Boots the real scene and plays it |
| `test/harness.gd` | The assertions. Deliberately small — see NOTES.md |
| `scripts/check_size.gd` | APK size guard, fails in both directions |
| `scripts/stamp.ps1` | Writes the build stamp from git |

## Invariants

- **`src/sim/` may not reference a Node, a Viewport, an input event or a real frame.**
  That one rule is what makes a whole-run golden test possible and what lets the whole
  renderer be replaced without touching game logic. If something in there needs to know
  about the world, it takes it as an argument.
- **Nothing that affects game state may use `randf()`.** Place-keyed decisions go through
  `SimUtil.hash2` seeded on (chunk, level); stream-like values go through `SimRng`.
  Cosmetic jitter may use `randf()`. The trap is that "cosmetic" is not obvious — **a
  value that decides *when* something happens is simulation**, even if it looks like
  decoration. On the sibling web game, loot scatter velocity looked decorative and was
  deciding when score landed, which made the golden flake one run in ten.
- **The hash uses unsigned shifts on a masked 32-bit value.** A signed shift clears the
  top bit and the function silently returns only `[0, 0.5)` — which disabled three
  shipped mechanics on another game for its entire life, with no error. `test_util.gd`
  asserts the range and the distribution.
- **`_ready` does not run at `add_child()`.** It is deferred to the first processed
  frame, so a headless harness that adds the scene and immediately steps it finds every
  field null. `main.gd` guards this with `_ensure_booted()`; keep that guard.
- **Use `Transform3D.looking_at`, not `Node3D.look_at`.** The node method requires the
  node to be inside the tree and errors when it is not — which is exactly the headless
  case. The transform method is pure maths and works anywhere.
- **`visible_instance_count` is the flush.** Every MultiMesh is a reset → push → flush
  pipeline and forgetting the flush fails completely silently: the simulation carries on
  perfectly and nothing is drawn. `run_smoke.gd` compares the count against the model.
- **Freeze before advancing** in any harness, or results move with the speed of the
  machine.

## Things the exporter will not tell you clearly

- `rendering/textures/vram_compression/import_etc2_astc=true` is **required** for an
  Android export. Without it the export fails with a message about Project Settings.
- A `config/icon` is required, or the export errors even though it still writes a file.
- `gradle_build/use_gradle_build=false` uses the prebuilt template and needs no Gradle
  at all. Turn it on only when a plugin or a custom target SDK demands it — and check
  the target API level against Play's requirement when you do.

## Record as you go

Write lessons into `gamedev-notes` **in the same commit as the change that taught them**,
never at the end of a session. Several games run at once; a lesson recorded after this one
finishes is one the next game never got.
