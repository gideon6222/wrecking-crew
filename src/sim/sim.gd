extends RefCounted

## The whole game, with no renderer in it.
##
## This is the shape that everything else in the repo depends on. `Sim` owns
## every number that decides what happens; the scene in `src/game/` reads those
## numbers and draws them, and never the other way round. Two things fall out
## of that, and both are worth more than they cost:
##
## 1. `test/` can play a whole level in milliseconds with no window, no GPU and
##    no scene tree - so a golden test over an entire run is possible, which is
##    a far stronger safety net than testing any single function.
## 2. Rendering can be rewritten, or replaced entirely, without touching a line
##    of game logic.
##
## The rule that keeps it true: **nothing in this file may reference a Node, a
## Viewport, an input event or a delta that came from a real frame.** If it
## needs to know something about the world, it takes it as an argument.
