## A deliberately small test harness.
##
## GUT and gdUnit4 both exist and both are good; this is here because the first
## job of this repo is to prove the pipeline - headless run, real assertions,
## non-zero exit, CI gate - with nothing to download and no chance of an addon
## lagging an engine release. It is about a hundred lines and it does the four
## things the tests here actually need.
##
## Swapping it for GUT later is a deliberate open decision, not an oversight.
## See NOTES.md. If the assertions below start growing doubles and mocks, that
## is the signal to switch.

## How close two floats have to be to count as the same in a golden.
##
## Not a fudge factor, and it took a failure that read "expected -0.825, got
## -0.825" to justify it. `snappedf(x, 0.001)` produces a double near -0.825
## whose last bits are not the same as the ones the literal `-0.825` parses to,
## so a recorded golden could never match the run it was recorded from - the
## test was unpassable by construction and said nothing about why.
##
## It earns its place a second time in CI. The goldens are recorded on Windows
## and checked on a Linux runner, and identical IEEE arithmetic on two
## toolchains is a thing people assume rather than a thing that is promised.
## A tolerance a thousand times finer than the snap cannot hide a behaviour
## change - the simulation would have to differ by less than a micron - and it
## stops the whole suite becoming a platform detector.
