## The random source, tested directly rather than through what it produces.
##
## This file exists because of a specific failure on the sibling web game: the
## same hash used signed right shifts, so it could never return above 0.5 -
## measured maximum 0.499999 over 800,000 samples. Nothing errored. Three
## mechanics whose spawn rolls compared against thresholds above a half had
## never once fired in the whole life of that game, and it failed as *absence*,
## which is the one failure mode a playtest cannot see.
##
## So: assert the range, assert the distribution, and assert that the specific
## thresholds this game compares against can actually come up.
